<h2>Data Deduplication</h2>

As the saying goes, time and storage space is money. So let's not waste any.

In an office environment, lot's of data will be duplicated a lot of the time. For example if User1 downloads a copy of "project-info.txt" and Users 2-300 do the same thing. 
That unaltered textfile will be on everyone's machine, wasting precious precious space. With deduplication we can make it so that each user will only get a pointer to that file and it won't
be copied over 300 times. A great idea in this case!

Let's start with adding the feature in our server manager.

<h2>Making a printer available for everyone</h2>

<br>
One way of making sure a printer is always accessable for your users is to reserve an IP address in your configured DHCP scope.

It's a good idea to give the device a very descriptive name.
Choose an IP address in the scope and type it in and then input the MAC address. You can find the MAC address usually on the device in the back though there are other ways to get it.
Next time the DHCP server gets contacted by a device with this MAC address it will aquire the reserved IP address.
